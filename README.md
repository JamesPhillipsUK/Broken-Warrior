# Broken Warrior
A Text-Based Adventure-Game, written in C

## History
Initially written in 2014 as a throwback to an earlier era of gaming, Broken Warrior is a traditional text adventure, written in the C Programming language.  Now remastered by it's original creator for a more modern era, Broken Warrior is suitable for any OS with a C Compiler.  The game begins with your capture and you must attempt to escape from a mysterious (if not somewhat cliched) forest world.
